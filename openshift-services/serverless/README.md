## Brokers and Channels

Channels are for point-to-point communications and are part of the `messaging.knative.dev` group.

Brokers are for routed, stored and forwarded communications and are part of the
`eventing.knative.dev` group.

Brokers are layered over Channels. The multi-tenant (MT) channel-based broker
requires an existing Channel implementation. By default it uses the
InMemoryChannel.

The Kafka broker depends on an existing Kafka cluster.

# MongoDB

Based on <https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-kubernetes-operator>.

The `deploy-operator.sh` script deploys the MongoDB operator and installs the `MongoDBCommunity` CRD.

For an example of how to create a DB cluster after the operator is deployed see
the [Superheroes app](./../../apps/superheroes/rest-fights).

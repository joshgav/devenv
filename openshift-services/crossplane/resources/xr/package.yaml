      This AWS starter configuration offers PostgreSQL as a service backed by
      RDS.
    meta.crossplane.io/readme: |
      This Configuration bundles an Upbound Cloud extension and an API
      definition. The API will allow control planes to provision fully
      configured Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) instances, composed
      using cloud service primitives from the [Upbound Official AWS
      Provider](https://marketplace.upbound.io/providers/upbound/provider-aws).
      The extension enables a hosted portal in Upbound Cloud for interacting
      with your control planeâ€™s APIs.
